BUG
Edited Lowry-Johnson/Goldstein Casting: deleted Twenties TBS Pilot from Past Projects
But Twenties TBS Pilot still has that casting office attached.
NOTE
The callback is currently after, needs to be before and compare if a project has been removed from the office, and then process accordingly. THIS IS NOT A NEW BUG


ISSUE
contactsToRemoveThisOfficeFrom / contactsToAddThisOfficeTo should be smarter — and don’t modify updatedAt for contacts that really don’t change
NOTE
THIS IS NOT A NEW BUG


BUG
removed a contact (Howard) from Twenties, but Howard still shows Twenties on his single
NOTE
somewhat similar to above
