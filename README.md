# V8 Alba
## Another start

Following the two-repo Vulcan starter, I added in Alba's React Starter 1.8.14, more or less.

## settings.json

I am not really using much here, certainly nothing to have git ignore, but going with that recommendation I leave it ignored and commit this brief bit of `settings.json`:

```
{
  "public": {
    "title": "V8 Alba",
    "tagline": "Alba 1.8.14",

    "faviconUrl": "/img/favicon.png",

    "locale": "en"
  }
}
```
## Notes to self

How to create an environment variable to account for different home directories?
