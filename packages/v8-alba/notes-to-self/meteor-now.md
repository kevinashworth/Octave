Following along https://docs.vulcanjs.org/deployment.html#Meteor-Now

1. Ran this from command line:

METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="/Users/kevinashworth/Developer/github_clones/Vulcan/packages" meteor-now -d -e ROOT_URL=https://v8alba.now.sh -e NODE_ENV=development -e MONGO_URL=***REMOVED***

Takes several minutes.

2. Error:

3. Try without custom domain:

METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="/Users/kevinashworth/Developer/github_clones/Vulcan/packages" meteor-now -d -e NODE_ENV=development -e MONGO_URL=***REMOVED***

4. See meteor-now-errors.txt

5. Trying `meteor-hero` instead:

METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="/Users/kevinashworth/Developer/github_clones/Vulcan/packages" meteor-hero -e NODE_ENV=development -e MONGO_URL=***REMOVED***
