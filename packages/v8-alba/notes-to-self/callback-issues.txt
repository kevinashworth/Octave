ISSUE
contactsToRemoveThisOfficeFrom / contactsToAddThisOfficeTo should be smarter — and don’t modify updatedAt for contacts that really don’t change
NOTE
THIS IS NOT A NEW BUG


BUG
removed a contact (Howard) from Twenties, but Howard still shows Twenties on his single
NOTE
somewhat similar to above
